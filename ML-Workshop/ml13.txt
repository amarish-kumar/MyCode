### Save and Load Machine Learning Models ###

#Finalize your model with pickle
- Pickle is the standard way of serializing obj in python. You can use the pickle1 operation to serialize your machine learning algos and save the serialized format to a file. Later you can load this to deserialize your model and use it to make new predictions.

### Predictive modelling project ###

- Any predictive modelling machine learning project can be broken down into six common tasks:
	1. Define problem
	2. Summarize data
	3. Prepare data
	4. Evaluate Algos
	5. Improve Results
	6. Present Results
