### Univariate Plots ###

- Histograms
A fast way to get an idea of the distribution of each attribute is to look at histograms.
Histograms group data into bins and provide you a count of the number of observations in each bin.
From the shape of the bins you can quickly get a feeling for whether an attribute is Gaussian',
skewed or even has an exponential distribution. It can also help you see possible outliers.

- Density plots
Density plots are another way of getting a quick idea of the distrib of each attrib. The plots look
like an abstracted histogram with a smooth curve drawn through the top of each bin, much like your eye
tried to do with the histograms. We can see the distrib for each attrib is clearer than the histograms.

- Box and whisker plots
Another useful way to review the distribution of each attrib is to use box and whisker plots or boxplots
for short. Boxplots summarize the distrib of each attrib, drawing a line for the median (middle value)
and a box around the 25th and 75th percentiles (the middle 50% of the data). The whiskers give an idea 
of the spread of the data and dots outside of the whiskers show candidate outlier values(values that are
1.5 times greater than the size of spread of the middle 50% of the data).

- Correlation Matrix plot
Correlation gives an indication of how related the changes are between two variables. If two variables
change in the same direction they are positively correlated. If the change is opposite dir together (one 
goes up, one goes down), then they are negatively correlated. You can calc the correlation matrix. You can then 
plot the correlation matrix and get an idea of which variables have a high correlation with each other.

- Scatter plot
A scatter plot shows the relationship between two variables as dots in two dimensions, one axis for each 
attrib. You can create a scatter plot for each pair of attrib in your data. Drawing all these scatter plots
together is called a scatter plot matrix. Scatter plots are useful for spotting structured relationships between variables, like whether you could summarize the relationship betn two vars with a line. Attrib
with structured reln may also be correlated and good candidates for removal from your dataset.
