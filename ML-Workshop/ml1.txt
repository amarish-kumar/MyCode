ML started in 1959 (chess).

Statical AI - 

Big Data - Cloudera, HortonWork, Map-R.

3V Concept - Volume, Velocity, and Variety.
4V - Veracity (mean, mod, etc.)
5V - Value

A computer program is said to: 'learn' from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

Steps in ML:
1. Collect data
2. Prepare the input data - Clense, format etc.
3. Analyse the input data - Plotting, finding features etc.
4. Train the algorithm - Run the designed algorithm on training data (not for unsupervised)
5. Test the algorithm - See to what extent it works on test data.
6. Use it - If the testing is successful, use it with new data for which we are trying to find an answer.

Major Classes:
- Supervised - labelled data, training data sets
Supervised algorithm is fed with a training data as well as the outputs which produces an inferred funcn and that is used for mapping new problems.

- Unsupervised
- Reinforcement
