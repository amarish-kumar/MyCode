The basic slice syntax is i: j: k, where i is the starting index, j is the stopping index, and k is the step and k is not equal to 0. This selects the m elements in the corresponding dimension, with index values i, i+k, ..., i + (m-1) k where m = q + (r not equal to 0) and q and r are the quotient and the remainder is obtained by dividing j-i by k:j-i = q k+r, so that i + (m-1) k < j.

Integer array indexing: Integer array indexing allows you to construct random arrays and other arrays.
a = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])
The returned array will have shape (2,)
